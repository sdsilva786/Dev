## Overview
Welcome to our project submission for the Agentic AI incubation! This repository contains the code and documentation for our innovative solution. Our project aims to build AI-powered multi-agent system for optimizing inventory management, predicting demand fluctuations, and managing suppliers while considering geopolitical risks in the automotive industry.

## Explanation
Our project leverages Python, LangGraph, Azure Open AI, Streamlit to create a web application. The core functionality includes:
- **Feature 1**: Fully Autonomous Multi Agent System. And modular design.

## Intent
The primary intent of our project is to build AI-powered multi-agent system for optimizing inventory management, predicting demand fluctuations, and managing suppliers while considering geopolitical risks in the automotive industry. We aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase supply chain resilience.

## Use Case
Assigned Industry Use Case:
Supply Chain : Manufacturing & Supply Chain Optimization.
 
Our solution is designed to be used by warehouses.
